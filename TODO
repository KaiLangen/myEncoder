1) Create tests for MacroBlock and Three-Step_Search files
   -still todo. but now have img io so this may be easier

2) Finish Motion Compensation / Motion Estimation module
   -more or less complete???

3) Implement DPCM (DC component redundancy)
   -still todo.

4) Implement Entropy coding component
   -still todo.

5) Handle JPEG input
   -putting off for now. Focusing instead on the videos in .y4m format. Easier to handle,
    and allow us to move forward on other components.
   -.y4m format is "planar" as opposed to "packed", meaning that the YUV channels are not
    interleaved. How to create macroblocks and prediction blocks from this???

6) Ensure that output conforms with MPEG1/2 video format
   -still todo. Header format demonstrated in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macroblock
   -probably better to start by emulating the H.261 standard and adding from there
